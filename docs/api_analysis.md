# Veeam API Analysis & Enhancement Opportunities

## Current API Usage
Your existing system uses:
- `GET /api/v1/jobs/states` - Job status information
- `GET /api/v1/backupInfrastructure/repositories/states` - Repository storage info

## Additional API Endpoints for Enhanced Monitoring

### 1. Immediate Status Monitoring
```
GET /api/v1/jobs - List all backup jobs
GET /api/v1/jobs/{id} - Get specific job details
GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}/sessions - Get job session history
GET /api/v1/sessions - Get all backup sessions
GET /api/v1/sessions/{id} - Get specific session details
GET /api/v1/sessions/states - Get session states summary
```

### 2. Real-time Alerting
```
GET /api/v1/jobs/states - Current job states (already used)
GET /api/v1/sessions/states - Session states for active monitoring
GET /api/v1/backupInfrastructure/repositories - Repository details
GET /api/v1/backupInfrastructure/repositories/{id} - Specific repository info
GET /api/v1/infrastructure/servers - Backup server status
GET /api/v1/infrastructure/servers/{id}/status - Server health status
```

### 3. Detailed Backup Reports
```
GET /api/v1/reports/summary/overview - System overview report
GET /api/v1/reports/summary/job_statistics - Job statistics
GET /api/v1/reports/summary/repository_statistics - Repository statistics
GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}/logs - Session logs for troubleshooting
GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}/includes - What's included in backup jobs
GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}/excludes - What's excluded from backup jobs
```

### 4. Infrastructure Monitoring
```
GET /api/v1/infrastructure/servers - Backup infrastructure servers
GET /api/v1/infrastructure/proxies - Backup proxies
GET /api/v1/infrastructure/repositories - All repositories
GET /api/v1/infrastructure/wan_accelerators - WAN accelerators
GET /api/v1/infrastructure/tape_servers - Tape infrastructure
```

### 5. Advanced Analytics
```
GET /api/v1/sessions?filter=creationTime - Time-based session filtering
GET /api/v1/jobs?filter=isEnabled - Filter enabled/disabled jobs
GET /api/v1/sessions?filter=result - Filter by success/failure
GET /api/v1/sessions?filter=endTime - Recent session analysis
```

## Enhancement Recommendations

### 1. Real-time Status Dashboard
- Monitor active sessions in real-time
- Track job progress and ETA
- Display infrastructure health status
- Show current backup operations

### 2. Proactive Alert System
- Failed job notifications within minutes
- Storage threshold warnings (60%, 80%, 90%)
- Infrastructure component failures
- Long-running job alerts
- Backup window violations

### 3. Comprehensive Reporting
- Daily backup success/failure summary
- Weekly trend analysis
- Monthly capacity planning reports
- Quarterly infrastructure health reports
- Custom time-range reports

### 4. Scheduled Monitoring Features
- Hourly status checks during backup windows
- Daily summary reports
- Weekly trend analysis
- Monthly capacity planning
- Quarterly infrastructure reviews

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Immediate Status (High Priority)
1. Real-time job monitoring
2. Active session tracking
3. Infrastructure health checks
4. Immediate failure alerts

### Phase 2: Enhanced Alerting (Medium Priority)
1. Threshold-based storage alerts
2. Performance degradation detection
3. Backup window compliance monitoring
4. Infrastructure component monitoring

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics (Lower Priority)
1. Predictive failure analysis
2. Capacity planning automation
3. Performance trend analysis
4. Cost optimization recommendations

## API Rate Limiting Considerations
- Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use batch requests where possible
- Monitor API response times
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for resilience
